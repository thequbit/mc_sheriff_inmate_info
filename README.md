======================

Tool for collating Monroe County Sheriff inmate census data

This repo pulls pdf data from this site:

  http://www2.monroecounty.gov/sheriff-inmate
  
It then pulls the data out of hte PDF, and places it within a database and provides a set of API functions to allow for data querying.

The goal of polling this data and collating it is to generate an way to pull trends and heat maps out of the data more easily.
